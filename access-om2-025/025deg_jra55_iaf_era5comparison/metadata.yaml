  0.25 degree ACCESS-OM2 global model configuration with JRA55-do v1.5.0
  interannual forcing (1980-2019)
long_description: |-
  0.25 degree ACCESS-OM2 global model configuration under interannual forcing.
  The configuration is based on that described in Kiss et al. (2020),
  https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-13-401-2020, but with many improvements.
  Initial conditions are WOA13v2 potential temperature and practical salinity.
  Run with JRA55-do v1.5.0 interannually-varying forcing with all solid runoff
  converted to liquid runoff with no heat transfer.
  Spin up starts 1 Jan 1980 and runs to 1 Jan 2019.
  This run differs from OMIP-2 runs (025deg_jra55_iaf_omip2_cycle*) in that it
  uses JRA55-do v1.5.0 forcing rather than v1.4.0, and the spin-up begins in
  1980 instead of 1958 to facilitate an apples-to-apples comparison with the 
  ERA5 run 025deg_era5_iaf.
