nominal_resolution:
  - 0.25 degrees
version: 1
description: |-
  0.25 degree ACCESS-OM2 global model configuration with ERA5 interannual
  forcing (1980-2021)
long_description: |-
  0.25 degree ACCESS-OM2 global model configuration under interannual forcing.
  The configuration is based on that described in Kiss et al. (2020),
  https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-13-401-2020, but with many improvements.
  Initial conditions are WOA13v2 potential temperature and practical salinity.
  Run with ERA5 interannually-varying atmospheric forcing fields and JRA-55 v1.5.0
  riverine and land-ice runoff.
  Spin up starts 1 Jan 1980 and runs to 1 Jan 2021.
